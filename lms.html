                    The switch to online classes for the spring of 2020 was difficult for both students and professors,
                    but many of those difficulties were a result of complicated online tools. For one of my final projects, I 
                    did a case study on an LMS, and attempted to design a simpler solution.

            <h3 class="section-title">How Can Online Learning Mimic the Classroom?</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
                When classes moved online spring semester, my professors, my classmates, and I all expressed
                frustration with the feeling of disconnect that comes with online learning. Things that were easy
                to do in the classroom (using a presentation, answering questions, and even meeting synchronously)
                were difficult to accomplish online.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                These challenges were made worse because many of my classes used multiple platforms, making it 
                difficult to keep track of what was happening when, or where. I wanted to design a platform that 
                included all the major facets of in person learning, without the need to learn multiple different 
                softwares.

            <h3 class="section-title">The Questions</h3>
            <ul class="section-text">
                <li>
                    How can the time spent on setup in online classes be minimized, and actual teaching time increased?
                </li>
                <li>How can professors keep track of attendance and ensure students know when lectures are 
                    happening in a non-invasive way? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    What makes students feel disconnected from the online learning process? What makes professors feel overwhelmed
                    when transitioning to online teaching?

            <p class="section-text">
                After surveying both students and professors, I had a better idea of what each group's ideal 
                online learning environment would look like.
